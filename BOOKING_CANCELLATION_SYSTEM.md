# Booking Cancellation System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive booking cancellation system for TurismApp that allows both guests and property owners to cancel bookings with automatic email notifications and proper status management.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. New Booking Cancellation Endpoint
**Location**: `BookingController.java`
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/bookings/{bookingId}/cancel`

**Features**:
- ✅ Authorization checks (guest, owner, or admin can cancel)
- ✅ Status validation (cannot cancel already cancelled/completed bookings)
- ✅ Comprehensive debug logging with emoji indicators
- ✅ Automatic email notifications to relevant parties
- ✅ Detailed response with cancellation context

### 2. Enhanced BookingService
**Location**: `BookingService.java`

**New Methods**:
- `getBookingById(Long bookingId)` - Retrieve booking by ID
- `cancelBookingWithNotifications(Booking booking, User cancelledBy)` - Cancel booking with email notifications

**Features**:
- ✅ Business logic validation
- ✅ Status management (sets status to CANCELLED)
- ✅ Smart email routing based on who cancelled
- ✅ Error handling that doesn't break cancellation if emails fail

### 3. New Email Notification Methods
**Location**: `EmailService.java`

**New Methods**:
- `sendBookingCancellationToGuest(Booking booking, User cancelledBy)`
- `sendBookingCancellationToOwner(Booking booking, User cancelledBy)`

**Features**:
- ✅ Personalized email content based on who cancelled
- ✅ Complete booking details in emails
- ✅ Professional email formatting with borders and emojis
- ✅ RON currency labeling
- ✅ Context-aware messaging

### 4. Enhanced Booking Entity
**Location**: `Booking.java`

**New Fields Added**:
- `guestPhone` - Guest phone number
- `numberOfGuests` - Number of guests
- `specialRequests` - Special requests from guest

### 5. Database Migration
**Location**: `migration_booking_enhancements.sql`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added new columns: `guest_phone`, `number_of_guests`, `special_requests`, `status`
- ✅ Added status enum constraint
- ✅ Added validation constraints
- ✅ Added performance indexes
- ✅ Updated existing records to CONFIRMED status

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. BookingCancelButton Component
**Location**: `components/BookingCancelButton.jsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Two display modes: compact and full
- ✅ Authorization-aware (shows only for valid users)
- ✅ Status-aware (only shows for cancellable bookings)
- ✅ Confirmation modal with booking details
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Integration with toast notifications

### 2. BookingStatusBadge Component
**Location**: `components/BookingStatusBadge.jsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Color-coded status indicators
- ✅ Icons for each status type
- ✅ Multiple size options
- ✅ Consistent styling across the app

### 3. Enhanced BookingsPage
**Location**: `pages/BookingsPage.jsx`

**Updates**:
- ✅ Integrated new cancel button component
- ✅ Uses new status badge component
- ✅ Handles booking cancellation callbacks
- ✅ Shows actual booking status from backend
- ✅ Enhanced booking data processing

### 4. Fixed BookingForm Integration
**Location**: `pages/UnitsListPage.jsx`

**Fix**:
- ✅ Uses correct price field (`pricePerNight`) for calculations

## Profit Calculation Impact

### ✅ Cancelled Bookings Excluded from Profits
The profit calculation methods in `AccommodationUnitService.java` already filter by status:
- `getMonthlyProfit()` - Only includes CONFIRMED/COMPLETED bookings
- `getOwnerProfitAnalytics()` - Only includes CONFIRMED/COMPLETED bookings  
- `getOwnerTotalProfit()` - Only includes CONFIRMED/COMPLETED bookings

**Result**: Cancelled bookings are automatically excluded from all profit calculations.

## Authorization Matrix

| User Type | Can Cancel Own Bookings | Can Cancel Others' Bookings | Email Notifications |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Guest** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Owner notified |
| **Owner** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (for their properties) | Guest notified |
| **Admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (any booking) | Both parties notified |

## Status Lifecycle

```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED
    ↓         ↓
CANCELLED ← CANCELLED
```

**Cancellation Rules**:
- ✅ PENDING bookings can be cancelled
- ✅ CONFIRMED bookings can be cancelled  
- ❌ COMPLETED bookings cannot be cancelled
- ❌ Already CANCELLED bookings cannot be cancelled again
