# ACCOUNT DELETION AND PASSWORD RESET FIX GUIDE

## ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### 1. **Password Reset Not Working**
- **Problem**: Password reset and forgot password functionality was broken
- **Root Cause**: Frontend components were using direct `axios` instead of the configured `api` instance
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated `ResetPasswordForm.jsx` to use `api` from `../services/axios`
  - Updated `ForgotPasswordForm.jsx` to use `api` from `../services/axios`
  - This ensures proper base URL and header configuration

### 2. **Account Deletion Database Constraints**
- **Problem**: Account deletion was failing due to database foreign key constraints
- **Root Cause**: Bookings made by the user as a guest were not being deleted before user deletion
- **Fix**:
  - Added `findByGuestEmail()` method to `BookingRepository`
  - Updated `UserService.deleteUserAccount()` to delete guest bookings first
  - Improved deletion order: Guest bookings ‚Üí Owned units ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Tokens ‚Üí User
  - Added comprehensive logging for each deletion step

### 3. **Missing Admin Email Notification for Owner Applications**
- **Problem**: Admin was not receiving email notifications when users applied to become owners
- **Root Cause**: The `OwnerApplicationService.submitApplication()` method was NOT calling the admin notification method
- **Fix**: 
  - Added admin email configuration to `application.properties`
  - Created `sendOwnerApplicationNotificationToAdmin()` method in `EmailService`
  - Updated `submitApplication()` to call the admin notification method
  - Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient error handling in both frontend and backend
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced frontend error handling with specific error messages
  - Added comprehensive backend logging with step-by-step process tracking
  - Added test endpoints for debugging

```

### 2. Test Password Reset Email

```

### 4. Test Account Deletion (Backend)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/test-delete-account?email=test@example.com"

## DELETION PROCESS ORDER

The account deletion now follows this specific order to avoid database constraints:

1. **Delete Guest Bookings**: Remove all bookings made by the user as a guest on other properties
2. **Delete Owned Units**: Remove all accommodation units owned by the user (cascade deletes their bookings, photos, reviews)
3. **Delete Owner Applications**: Remove any owner application submitted by the user
4. **Delete Confirmation Tokens**: Remove email confirmation tokens
5. **Delete Password Reset Tokens**: Remove password reset tokens
6. **Delete User Account**: Finally delete the user (cascade deletes reviews written by the user)
