# Owner Application System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive owner application system that prevents duplicate applications and provides proper status tracking.

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **New Entities Created:**
   - `OwnerStatus.java` - Enum with values: NONE, PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED
   - `OwnerApplication.java` - Entity to track applications
   - `OwnerApplicationRepository.java` - Repository for database operations
   - `OwnerApplicationService.java` - Business logic for applications
   - `OwnerApplicationController.java` - REST endpoints

2. **Updated Existing Entities:**
   - `User.java` - Added `ownerStatus` field with default NONE
   - `UserResponseDTO.java` - Added `ownerStatus` field to include in API responses

3. **Registration Flow Updated:**
   - When user selects "OWNER" during registration, they are created as GUEST with ownerStatus PENDING
   - An OwnerApplication record is automatically created
   - User must still verify email and wait for admin approval

4. **API Endpoints Added:**
   - `POST /api/owner-applications` - Submit application
   - `GET /api/owner-applications/my-application` - Get user's application status
   - `GET /api/owner-applications/can-apply` - Check eligibility
   - `GET /api/owner-applications/pending` - Get pending applications (admin)
   - `POST /api/owner-applications/{id}/approve` - Approve application (admin)
   - `POST /api/owner-applications/{id}/reject` - Reject application (admin)

### Frontend Changes

1. **AuthContext Enhanced:**
   - Added helper functions: `hasOwnerApplicationPending()`, `hasOwnerApplicationApproved()`, `hasOwnerApplicationRejected()`
   - Updated `canApplyAsOwner()` to check ownerStatus === 'NONE'

2. **New Components:**
   - `OwnerApplicationBanner.jsx` - Shows status banner for different application states
   - `ownerApplicationService.js` - API service for owner applications

3. **Updated Components:**
   - `Layout.jsx` - Added OwnerApplicationBanner to show status messages
   - `NavBar.jsx` - Updated to use new auth functions (already had correct logic)

4. **UI Behavior:**
   - "Apply as Owner" button only shows for users with ownerStatus === 'NONE'
   - Status banner appears for users with PENDING, APPROVED, or REJECTED status
   - Banner automatically disappears when status is NONE

### Database Schema

1. **New Table:** `owner_applications`
   - Tracks all application submissions
   - Links to users table
   - Stores admin review notes and timestamps

2. **Updated Table:** `users`
   - Added `owner_status` column with default 'NONE'
   - Existing OWNER users get 'APPROVED' status

## Application Flow

### Registration with Owner Intent:
1. User selects "OWNER" during registration
2. Account created as GUEST with ownerStatus PENDING
3. OwnerApplication record created automatically
4. User receives email verification
5. After verification and login, sees "Under Review" banner

### Manual Application (existing users):
1. GUEST user with ownerStatus NONE sees "Apply as Owner" button
2. Clicks button, submits application
3. ownerStatus changes to PENDING
4. "Apply as Owner" button disappears
5. "Under Review" banner appears

### Admin Review:
1. Admin sees pending applications in admin panel
2. Admin approves or rejects with optional notes
3. User role and status updated accordingly
4. User sees updated banner with result

### Status Messages:
- **PENDING:** "Under Review" - yellow banner with clock icon
- **APPROVED:** "Approved!" - green banner with check icon (for role transition period)
- **REJECTED:** "Not Approved" - red banner with X icon
- **NONE:** No banner shown

## Security Features

1. **Duplicate Prevention:** Users can only submit one application ever
2. **Role Validation:** Only GUEST users can apply
3. **Status Validation:** Only users with ownerStatus NONE can apply
4. **Admin Protection:** Only ADMIN users can approve/reject
5. **JWT Authentication:** All endpoints require valid tokens

## Database Migration

Run the `migration_owner_applications.sql` file to:
- Add `owner_status` column to `users` table
- Create `owner_applications` table
- Update existing OWNER users to have APPROVED status
- Add constraints and indexes

## Testing Checklist

### Registration Flow:
- [ ] Register as GUEST - should have ownerStatus NONE
- [ ] Register as OWNER - should have ownerStatus PENDING and auto-created application
- [ ] Verify email works for both scenarios
- [ ] Login shows appropriate banner/button state

### Application Flow:
- [ ] GUEST with NONE status can see "Apply as Owner" button
- [ ] After application, button disappears and banner shows "Under Review"
- [ ] Cannot submit duplicate applications
- [ ] OWNER users cannot apply

### Admin Flow:
- [ ] Admin can see pending applications
- [ ] Approval changes user to OWNER role and APPROVED status
- [ ] Rejection keeps GUEST role but changes to REJECTED status
- [ ] User sees updated banner after admin action

### UI States:
- [ ] Banner shows for PENDING (yellow/under review)
- [ ] Banner shows for APPROVED (green/congratulations)
- [ ] Banner shows for REJECTED (red/not approved)
- [ ] No banner for NONE status
- [ ] "Apply as Owner" only visible for GUEST + NONE status
