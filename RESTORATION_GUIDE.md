# üîÑ Complete Project Restoration Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING
This will **PERMANENTLY DELETE** all local changes and restore your project to match the exact state of the GitHub repository main branch. This includes removing all experimental owner application approval system code.

## üöÄ Automated Restoration (Recommended)

### Option 1: Use the Restoration Script
```bash
# Run the automated script
restore-from-github.bat
```

This script will:
1. Create a backup of your current state
2. Fetch latest changes from GitHub
3. Reset to GitHub main branch
4. Clean all untracked files
5. Verify the restoration

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Restoration Commands

### Option 2: Manual Git Commands
If you prefer to run commands manually:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd d:\razu\Licenta\SCD\TurismApp

# 1. Create backup (optional but recommended)
xcopy /E /I /H /Y . "..\backup_before_reset"

# 2. Fetch latest from GitHub
git fetch origin main

# 3. Reset to GitHub main branch (DESTRUCTIVE - removes all local changes)
git reset --hard origin/main

# 4. Clean untracked files (DESTRUCTIVE - removes new files)
git clean -fd

# 5. Verify restoration
git status
```

### Option 3: VS Code Git Integration
1. Open VS Code in your project folder
2. Open Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
3. Click on "..." (More Actions) menu
4. Select "Branch" ‚Üí "Checkout to..."
5. Select "origin/main"
6. When prompted, choose "Force Checkout" to discard local changes
7. In terminal, run `git clean -fd` to remove untracked files

## üìÅ Files That Will Be Removed

The following experimental files will be deleted:

### Backend Files
- `src/main/java/com/licentarazu/turismapp/controller/OwnerApplicationApprovalController.java` (if modified)
- Any new controller methods or endpoints added recently

### Frontend Files
- `New front/src/pages/OwnerApplicationResponsePage.jsx`
- `New front/src/pages/AdminDemoPage.jsx`  
- `New front/src/components/AdminOwnerApplicationsPanel.jsx`
- Modified `New front/src/services/ownerApplicationService.js`
- Modified `New front/src/router/AppRouter.jsx`

### Documentation & Scripts
- `OWNER_APPROVAL_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`
- `test-approval-system.bat`
- `approval-system-summary.bat`
- Any other experimental documentation

## üîç Verification Steps

After restoration, verify everything is working:

### 1. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
# Should show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

git log --oneline -5
# Should show recent commits from GitHub
```

### 2. Build and Test Backend
```bash
# Clean and compile
mvnw clean compile

# Run tests (if any)
mvnw test

# Start backend
mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Build and Test Frontend
```bash
cd "New front"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Core Functionality
- User registration and login
- Owner application submission (basic version)
- Any other core features that were working before

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Restore from Backup
If the automated script created a backup:
```bash
# Navigate to backup location
cd d:\razu\Licenta\SCD\backup_*

# Copy backup back to project
xcopy /E /I /H /Y . ..\TurismApp
```

### Re-clone Repository
If all else fails, completely re-clone:
```bash
# Navigate to parent directory
cd d:\razu\Licenta\SCD\

# Remove current project
rmdir /S /Q TurismApp

# Clone fresh from GitHub
git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL] TurismApp

# Navigate to project
cd TurismApp

# Install dependencies
cd "New front"
npm install
```

## üìã Post-Restoration Checklist
