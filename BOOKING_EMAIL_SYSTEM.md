## 🚀 **API Usage**

### **Create Booking with Email Notifications**
```http
POST /api/bookings

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "accommodationUnit": {
    "id": 1
  },
  "checkInDate": "2024-07-01",
  "checkOutDate": "2024-07-05", 
  "guestName": "John Doe",
  "guestEmail": "john.doe@email.com"
}
```

### **Response**
```json
{
  "message": "Booking created successfully! Confirmation emails have been sent.",
  "bookingId": 123,
  "totalPrice": 400.0
}
```

## 🔍 **Error Handling**

### **Validation Errors**
- Missing accommodation unit
- Invalid date ranges  
- Missing guest email
- Past check-in dates

### **Business Logic Errors**
- Unit not available (overlapping bookings)
- Unit not found in database

### **Email Failures**
- Email service failures don't break the booking process
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation if SMTP issues occur

## 📊 **Logging & Monitoring**

All email operations are logged with different levels:
- **INFO**: Successful operations and flow tracking
- **WARN**: Non-critical issues (missing data)
- **ERROR**: Email sending failures and exceptions

Example log entries:
```
INFO  - Creating new booking for unit: Cozy Apartment by guest: John Doe
INFO  - ✅ Booking saved successfully with ID: 123
INFO  - Sending booking confirmation email to guest: john.doe@email.com
INFO  - ✅ BOOKING CONFIRMATION EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY to guest: john.doe@email.com
INFO  - Sending booking notification email to owner: owner@email.com
INFO  - ✅ BOOKING NOTIFICATION EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY to owner: owner@email.com
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Requirements**

The system uses the existing Gmail SMTP configuration from `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your-email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your-app-password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Manual Testing Steps**:
1. Start the backend: `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`
2. Create a booking via POST request to `/api/bookings`
3. Check email inboxes for both guest and owner
4. Verify booking appears in database
5. Check application logs for email delivery status

### **Test Data Example**:
```json
{
  "accommodationUnit": {"id": 1},
  "checkInDate": "2024-08-01", 
  "checkOutDate": "2024-08-05",
  "guestName": "Test Guest",
  "guestEmail": "test@example.com"
}
```

## 🎉 **Benefits**

2. **Professional Experience**: Both parties receive detailed information
3. **Error Resilience**: Bookings succeed even if emails fail
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for troubleshooting
5. **Scalable**: Can handle multiple bookings simultaneously
6. **Template-Based**: Easy to modify email content

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements for the future:
